# Welcome to Libra

Libra is dedicated to creating an open, extensible music service that empowers users to enjoy music the way they want.

Our main projects include:
- **LibraCore**: Aims to provide a powerful backend and API for the music service.
- **LibraFlow** The main frontend, offering a beautiful and accessible user interface for all platforms.
- **LibraTUI**: A terminal-based user interface for those who prefer command-line interactions.

## Roadmap

Some of the project's future goals include:
- A simple but powerful backend & API
- A beautiful and accessible frontend for all platforms, both web and native
- An opt-in playback syncing mechanism to share what is currently playing between applications on either one or every device
- A plugins system, so you can extend Libra even more than normal
- An Amazon Alexa skill
- An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin to control your music while taking notes
