# Welcome to Libra

Libra is dedicated to creating an open, extensible music service that empowers users to enjoy music the way they want.

## Goals

Some of the project's primary goals include:
- A simple but powerful backend & API
- A beautiful and accessible frontend for all platforms, both web and native
- Integrations with a variety of applications
- An opt-in playback syncing mechanism to share what is currently playing between applications on either one or every device
- A plugins system, so you can extend Libra even more than normal
